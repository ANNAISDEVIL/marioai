    "While achieving slightly better results than the online RL approach in the easy and medium level, the offline DQN approach was not able to perform any better than the online implementation in the hard level we tested them both on.\n",
    "Our guess would be the lack of training data as mastering a level of this complexity would require a level of understanding of the environment that the network was not able to abstract from the data we were able to provide.\n",
    "This also demonstrates the biggest issue with the offline RL approach: it's high dependence on good and plentiful data.\n",
    "Creating such data is a time-consuming and often times an expensive endeavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, even with limited data the offline approach was still able to generalize better than the online approach, as we have learned from our evaluation on random levels.\n",
    "We also believe that there is room to improve for the offline approach even without providing additional data.\n",
    "For example, we expect that the training results with our limited amount of data might be improved by adding a Convolutional Neural Network to the DQN.\n",
    "This might lead to a precise Pixel recognition of the matrix that our\n",
    "agent perceives thus leading to better reactions in certain situations with the training data of one balanced level which the player faces different situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world offline RL is often times the only sensible way to use an ML model as online learning would simply be too dangerous or slow. \n",
    "However, this comes with the price of the agent not being able to explore different approaches on its own meaning an often times subpar training result.\n",
    "Companies like Tesla have acknowledged this issue and have been training their self-driving cars in a life like simulated environment in which they reproduce difficult situations the car might encounter to explore without any real world damages. [[3]](https://youtu.be/11QXiJ8ORe8?t=3187)"
